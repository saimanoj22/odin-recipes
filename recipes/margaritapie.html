    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup finely crushed pretzels</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>â…“ cup margarine, melted</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>â…“ cup frozen limeade concentrate, thawed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tequila</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon orange liqueur</li>
        <li>3 drops green food coloring, or as needed (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 lime, sliced (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix pretzels and sugar together in a bowl; stir in margarine until evenly incorporated. Spoon mixture into a
            9-inch pie plate; press into bottom and up sides of plate to form a firm, even crust.</li>
        <li>Bake crust in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Mix sweetened condensed milk, limeade concentrate, tequila, orange liqueur, and green food coloring in a
            large bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat cream in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the
            whipped cream will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold whipped cream into sweetened condensed
            milk mixture. Spoon filling into cooled crust.</li>
        <li>Cover pie with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, about 4 hours. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving;
            garnish with lime slices.</li>
    </ol>
